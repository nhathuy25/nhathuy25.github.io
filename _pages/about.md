Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I'm currently a Research Intern specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Energy-efficient Inference methods at Orange Innovation in Chatillon, Ile-de-France where I explore lastest techniques to optimize AI inference.

My academic foundation comes from INSA Centre Val de Loire, where I studied Engineering with a focus on Mechatronics and Information Technology. This interdisciplinary background has equipped me with a unique perspective on physics, hardware and software aspects.

My technical interest centers around AI Generative technologies, Large Language Models, optimization techniques, and Deep Learning architectures. I'm particularly interested in developing efficient AI solutions that balance performance with computational resources on High Perfomance Computer (HPU) and GPUs.

I've demonstrated my technical abilities by participating in the national programming contest in Hanoi in 2022 and [various projects](/projects/), . My language proficiency includes English (C1 certified) and French (B2 certified), enabling me to collaborate effectively in international research environments.

Currently, I'm actively seeking an applied research position (PhD) in Deep Learning and Multimodal AI, where I can contribute to advancing the field while solving real-world challenges.
